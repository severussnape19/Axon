# Axon
A personal deep learning library built from scratch — one layer, one gradient, one insight at a time.

Axon is a private project where I’m building a minimal deep learning framework entirely from the ground up, using pure Python.
The goal isn’t performance or production. The goal is understanding.

By re-implementing the foundations of deep learning — tensors, forward passes, backpropagation, optimizers, and neural network layers — I hope to gain a deeper, more intuitive grasp of how modern AI systems actually work.

This is a learning-first project, not a production-ready library.
It's meant to be simple, readable, and educational — a tool to explore deep learning by building it, not just using it.

I may open-source it later, but for now, it’s a space for focused study and quiet iteration.
