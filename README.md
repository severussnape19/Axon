# Axon
A personal deep learning library built from scratch — one layer, one gradient, one insight at a time.

Axon is a personal project aimed at rebuilding the foundations of machine learning and deep learning from scratch. It includes both the mathematical backbone (like matrix operations, gradient functions, and numerical methods) and the building blocks of neural networks — all written manually in Python (and possibly C++ later).

This is not meant to compete with established libraries — it's a learning lab.
A place to write my own tensor engine, test ideas, and understand each moving part under the hood.
